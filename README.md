# Dataset of materials within glass vessels
New [data set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6njwynsu2hXRFpmY1pOV1A4SFE/view?usp=sharing) of images of materials in transparent vessels in chemistry laboratory setting is presented. This data set contains a thousand images with pixel-wise annotation according to categories ranging from filled and empty to the exact physical phase of the material inside the vessel (liquid, solid, powder, foam, vaporsâ€¦). 

The data set can be downloaded from each of the following links:

## General 
Handling of materials in glassware vessels in the primary task in chemistry laboratory research as well as a large number of other activities.  Visual recognition of the physical phase of the materials is essential to for many methods ranging from a simple task like fill level evaluation to identifying more complex properties such a solvation,  precipitation, crystallization, phase separation.  To help train neural nets for this task a new dataset is presented.  The data set contains a thousand images of materials in different phases and involved in different chemical processes, in a laboratory setting. 
## Dataset labels
Each pixel in each image is labeled according to several layers of classification given below (Figure 1): 

a. Vessel/Background: For each pixel assign value of 1 if it part of the vessel and 0 otherwise. This label was used as ROI map for valve filters method. 

b. Filled/Empty: similar to above but also distinguish between filled and empty regions of the vessel. Assign for each pixel one of the three values: 0) Background, 1) Empty vessel. 2) Filled vessel. 

c. Phase type: Similar to above but distinguish between liquid and solid regions of the filled vessel. Assign for each pixel one of the four values: 0) Background, 1) Empty vessel. 2) Liquid. 3) Solid.

d. Exact physical phase of material: Similar to above but distinguish between specific physical phases classes. For each pixel assign one of 15 values: 1) Background. 2) Empty Vessel. 3) Liquid. 4) Liquid Phase two (in case more than one phase of liquid appear in the vessel). 5) Suspension. 6) Emulsion. 7) Foam. 8) Solid. 9) Gel. 10) Powder. 11) Granular. 12) Bulk. 13) Solid and liquid mixture. 14) Solid Phase two (in case more than one phase of solid exist in the vessel). 15) Vapor.

The annotations are given as images in the size of the original image where the pixel value is the class number.

## Validation/Testing set:
The data set is divided into training and validation sets. The testing set is used to test the predictions of nets which was trained using the training set. The testing set is by itself divided into two subsets: One set contains images extracted from the same youtube channels as the training set and therefore was taken under similar conditions as the training images.  The second subset contains images extracted from youtube channels not included in the training set and hence contain images taken under different conditions from that of the images used for training the net.  The purpose of the second set is to measure the overfitting of the net to the specific conditions of the training set.

## Creating the dataset
Creating a large number of images with various of chemical processes and settings could have been a daunting task.  Luckily few youtube channels delicate to chemical experiments exist that supply high-quality footage of chemistry experiments. Thanks to these channels that include mainly the  NurdRage, NileRed, ChemPlayer,  and others, it was possible to collect a large number of high-quality images in short time. Pixel-Wise annotating of these images is another challenging task that was performed by Alexandra Emanuel and Mor Bismuth. 

## Supporting scripts
This repository contains three python script for reading and displaying the dataset.
### Data_Reader.py:
Reader for loading images and annotation from data set
### OverrlayLabelOnImage.py
Overlay the annotation/label on the image for display purpose
### RUN_OverLayGroundTruthLabel.py
A simple script that use the above scripts to read the annotations and images from the data set, and overlay the annotation on the image for display purpose.
